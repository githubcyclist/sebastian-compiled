        (If not, try again later, when I should have fixed the link.)
      &nbsp;
        Extract the files. Open the "_Install" executable file.
      &nbsp;
        If you are on Windows Vista or later, you will get administrator prompts. Agree to them and to the license agreements for Microsoft Agent.
      &nbsp;  
      After you are done installing all that, there is one more thing left. To enable Double Agent, here are the steps:
      &nbsp;  
      1. Open the Control Panel. In the top right, select “Small icons” or “Large icons”.
      &nbsp;
        2. Find “Double Agent” in the list. Click on it. A settings window opens.
      &nbsp;
        3. Select the “Emulation” tab. Select “Use Double Agent”, and then “OK”.
      &nbsp;
        Setup of Double Agent is done!
      &nbsp;
        Now navigate into the "Program - Sebastian is in here" folder.
      &nbsp;
        Double-click on the "Sebastian.exe" file and enjoy Sebastian!
    </p>
    <h3>OPTIONAL:</h3>
    <p>
      You can also make Sebastian open at startup.

      Right-click on Sebastian.exe and select "Create shortcut".
      Select the shortcut, right-click on it, and click "Cut".
      Type "shell:startup" in the navigation bar at the top of the file explorer.
      Right-click in an empty space in the folder, and click "Paste". Done!
