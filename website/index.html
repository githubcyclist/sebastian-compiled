      Note that on Windows Vista and later, a lot of these characters will not install without an extra step.

      Right-click on the character installer of your choice, and select "Run as administrator".
      <br>
      You will be prompted. Click Yes. If it asks for a password, contact your computer administrator.

      After you are done installing all that, there is one more thing left. To enable Double Agent, here are the steps:

      1. Open the Control Panel. In the top right, select “Small icons” or “Large icons”.
      <br>
        2. Find “Double Agent” in the list. Click on it. A settings window opens.
      <br>
        3. Select the “Emulation” tab. Select “Use Double Agent”, and then “OK”.
      <br>
        Setup of Double Agent is done!
      <br>
        Now navigate into the "Program - Sebastian is in here" folder.
      <br>
        Double-click on the "Sebastian.exe" file and enjoy Sebastian!
    </p>

      You can also make Sebastian open at startup.

      Select the shortcut, right-click on it, and click "Cut".

      Type "shell:startup" in the navigation bar at the top of the file explorer.
