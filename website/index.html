    <p>
        A ZIP file downloads.
        (If not, try again later, when I should have fixed the link.)
        Extract the files. Open the "_Install" executable file.
        If you are on Windows Vista or later, you will get administrator prompts. Agree to them and to the license agreements for Microsoft Agent.
        After you are done installing all that, there is one more thing left. To enable Double Agent, here are the steps:
        1. Open the Control Panel. In the top right, select “Small icons” or “Large icons”.
        2. Find “Double Agent” in the list. Click on it. A settings window opens.
        3. Select the “Emulation” tab. Select “Use Double Agent”, and then “OK”.
        Setup of Double Agent is done!
        Now navigate into the "Program - Sebastian is in here" folder.
        Double-click on the "Sebastian.exe" file and enjoy Sebastian!
    </p>
    <h3>OPTIONAL:</h3>
    <p>
      You can also make Sebastian open at startup.

      Right-click on Sebastian.exe and select "Create shortcut".
      Select the shortcut, right-click on it, and click "Cut".
      Type "shell:startup" in the navigation bar at the top of the file explorer.
      Right-click in an empty space in the folder, and click "Paste". Done!
